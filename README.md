# ruby-cli-template

The user will be able to use this app to perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division calculations.
It will prompt the user to find out which of the 4 types of calculations they wish to perform, and then prompt the user for the 2 numbers they want to perform the calculation on.
If the used attempts to perform a division calculation by zero it will give an error message.
It will print the result of the calculation, and prompt the user as to whether they'd like to perform anothe operation or not.  
If they wish to perform another calculation it will go through the cycle again.
If not, it will thank the user for having used the calculator and end.
It includes a test file that I used to make sure it worked..
